# Python EDA
This is a collection of python scripts exploring the basics of exploratory data analysis (EDA) with python along with ways to enhance efficiencies in python EDA, such as using Auto EDA libraries.

### Python Basic EDA
This script examines the basics of EDA in Python using the very familiar Titanic dataset
It covers the fundamental topics of:
- Understanding the dataset structure
- Basic statistical summaries
- Data Cleaning
- Visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Handling categorical data
- Feature engineering
- Preliminary Insights

### Auto EDA with Python
Under the AutoEDA script is a collection of auto EDA libraries in Python and how to execute them along with their strengths and weaknesses.

The decision to use auto EDA depends on:
- specific needs of the project
- size and complexity of the dataset
- expertise of the user

**Auto EDA** tools offer a quick and efficient way to get a broad overview of the data.
<br> **Manual EDA** allows for more nuanced and detailed analysis.
